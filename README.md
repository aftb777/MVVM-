# MVVM-

A simple implementation of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern.  
This repository serves as a foundational template for organizing code in a clear and efficient way, separating the logic (Model), UI (View), and bridge (ViewModel).

## Features

- Modular structure based on MVVM principles
- Easily extendable for various project needs
- Clean, maintainable codebase

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aftb777/MVVM-.git

    ```

2. **Explore the code structure**
    - **Model:** Business logic/data layer
